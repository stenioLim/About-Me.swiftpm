# About Me ( APP Playground ) 
I created a simple playground app talking about me and my story along with my skills !

This APP was created entirely in swift as you can see, it's nothing impressive, we have 4 sections, where we can find the main page, my history, skills and fun functions.

Its entire interface was made using SwiftUI, very simple indeed, a very cool function that we managed to use was for the button that randomly generates phrases, also using scroolview( ), Group { }, Divider ( ), We work all the views modifers.

Despite being a simple application, it makes great use, even if basic, of Swift's functions.
